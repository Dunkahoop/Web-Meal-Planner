# Web Meal Planner

**Hi Sam!**

This is that web app you and your wife were interested in me developing. Right now it's a work-in-progress. Soon enough I'll get the styling done, right now I'm working on functionality. I know it's not entirely what you wanted, but I think it's quite useful as it is.

To install this, you need to do the following:

- Click on the green button reading `< > Code`
- Select the dropdown option `Download ZIP` at the very bottom
- Unzip the package in a file of your choice (preferably somewhere easily accessible)
- Open the file `webmealplanner.html`
- Enjoy!

If you have any problems using the app, please let me know. I'm open to suggestions for improving the app.
